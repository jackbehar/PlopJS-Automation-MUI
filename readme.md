## Problem Statement
As you all know react is a UI library and not come's with any structure like angular provide it's own structure to follow.
I know it's good to have own structure and not bound to any structure that framework provide. But I think when we are working in a team then we have to set a structure to follow and care about the naming convention to follow. So, every developer can follow the same.
That's where react plop template package is coming, Which is a wrapper over plop to generate react / react-native components, pages and reducers with it's necessary files and folders. You don't need to create a components, reducers and it's necessary files, the react-plop-template will do it for you.  
## What is React Plop Template?
React Plop Template is "micro-generator package." 
It is a small tool that gives you a simple way to generate your react / react-native components, pages and reducers in a consistent way.
